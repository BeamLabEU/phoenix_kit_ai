## 0.7.0 - 2026-06-10

### Added
- **Model-kind icon column on the AI Usage endpoints list.** A leading icon column (before the endpoint name, in both the table and card views) shows at a glance what kind of model each endpoint points at:
  - Text-to-Speech → `hero-speaker-wave`, Embedding → `hero-rectangle-stack`, Chat/Completion → `hero-chat-bubble-left-right`, each with a tooltip.
  - Classification is inferred from the model id via the new pure helpers `PhoenixKitAI.Endpoint.kind/1` (`:chat | :tts | :embedding`) and `kind_icon/1`, reusing the same `tts`/`embed` substring heuristic as the model picker (endpoints store no explicit type).

### Changed
- **Compacter endpoints toolbar.** The sort/filter UI now shares one row with the New Endpoint button + card/list toggle (moved from the `:sort_bar` slot into the core table's `:toolbar_title` slot) instead of stacking a second row beneath them. No core/`phoenix_kit` change required.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-06-10

### Added
- **Model-type selector on the endpoint form** (Chat / Text-to-Speech). Picking a type filters the fetched model list so TTS models no longer sit undifferentiated in the chat dropdown:
  - New `:tts` model type in `PhoenixKitAI.OpenRouterClient` (`fetch_models_by_type/3`, `model_matches_type?/2`). Since neither Mistral nor OpenRouter expose an audio modality flag, TTS models are matched by `tts` in the model id/name (e.g. `voxtral-mini-tts-2603`); the `:text`/Chat filter now excludes them so the chat picker stays clean. Speech-to-text/transcription models are intentionally not matched (no dedicated type yet).
  - The form re-runs its existing fetch with the selected `model_type`; editing an endpoint infers the type from its saved model id (TTS endpoints open on the TTS filter).
- **Per-endpoint default TTS voice.** A "Default Voice" field (shown only for the TTS type) is stored in `provider_settings["voice"]`; `PhoenixKitAI.speak/3` falls back to it when the caller passes no `:voice`/`:voice_id`. No migration — `provider_settings` is already a map.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-06-10

### Added
- **Text-to-speech support** (`PhoenixKitAI.speak/3`). Synthesizes speech from text through a configured AI endpoint and returns the raw audio bytes, mirroring the `embed/3` path (shared endpoint resolution, credential validation, error mapping, and request logging):
  - `PhoenixKitAI.speak(endpoint_uuid, text, opts)` → `{:ok, %{audio: binary(), format: String.t()}}`. Options: `:voice` (preset id) / `:voice_id` (saved/cloned id) — only the present one is sent, keeping the package provider-neutral — plus `:response_format` (default `"mp3"`) and `:source`.
  - `PhoenixKitAI.Completion.text_to_speech/3` posts to `/audio/speech` and decodes both response shapes: Mistral hosted base64-JSON (`{"audio_data": "<base64>"}`) and the raw binary audio body used by OpenRouter / OSS vLLM.
  - Request log gains a `"tts"` `request_type`. TTS carries no token usage (per-character billing), so rows record `input_chars`, `audio_format`, and `audio_bytes` instead; the input text honours the existing `capture_request_content` PII gate.
  - New `:invalid_audio_response` error reason in `PhoenixKitAI.Errors` for an unreadable/empty audio response.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-06-08

### Added
- **AI translation pipeline + UI (moved from core).** A generic, multi-consumer AI-translation layer now lives in the plugin; consumers (publishing/catalogue/projects) wire in a tiny adapter + form binding and get the rest for free:
  - `PhoenixKitAI.Translatable` — adapter behaviour: `fetch/2`, optional scoped `fetch/3`, `source_fields/2`, `put_translation/4`, optional `pubsub_topics/1`
  - `PhoenixKitAI.Translation` — the `ask_with_prompt/4` call + structured `---FIELD---` response parser, with every failure path normalized to `{:error, atom_or_tuple}`
  - `PhoenixKitAI.Translations` — enqueue, scope-aware in-flight dedup, payload-minimal PubSub broadcasts, `missing_languages/3`, and idempotent default endpoint/prompt provisioning
  - `PhoenixKitAI.TranslateWorker` — the generic Oban worker (threads `resource_scope` to `fetch/3` when the adapter exports it; transient-vs-deterministic retry/snooze/discard classification)
  - `PhoenixKitAI.Translatables` — duck-typed adapter discovery scanning `PhoenixKit.ModuleRegistry` for `ai_translatables/0`
  - `PhoenixKitAI.Components.AITranslate{,.Embed,.FormBinding,.FormGlue}` — the shared AI-translate modal UI + LiveView state/progress/stall glue
- **Reasoning-model parser hardening** (`PhoenixKitAI.Translation.parse_response/2`): strips balanced `<think>`/`<thinking>`/`<reasoning>`/`<thought>` blocks before parsing (an unclosed block is left intact so a real answer is never deleted) and anchors opening `---MARKER---` to start-of-line, so chain-of-thought that mentions a marker inline can't open a section. Reasoning output degrades to a clean `:no_markers` parse error instead of a mis-parsed blob that overflowed a consumer's column on persist.
- `PhoenixKitAI.Routes.ai_path/0` — plugin-owned `/admin/ai` path helper (was a module-specific helper in core's `PhoenixKit.Utils.Routes`)
- Reasoning-model UX hint under the endpoint selector in the AI-translate modal: reasoning models are slower and may return unstructured output — prefer a standard model for translation
- Env-gated local-path dep override in `mix.exs` (`<APP>_PATH`, e.g. `PHOENIX_KIT_PATH=../phoenix_kit`) for cross-repo development; unset resolves to the published Hex pin, so `mix deps.get` / `mix hex.publish` / CI are unaffected

### Changed
- Dependency refresh (`mix.lock`)

### Fixed
- AI-translate form applies a completed translation to the live changeset only for languages this session dispatched — a translation triggered in another session/tab on the same resource no longer clobbers unsaved edits
- `mix precommit` green end to end (credo `--strict` 0 issues, dialyzer 0 errors): closed pre-existing alias-order / nesting / alias-usage findings via behavior-preserving extraction, and removed a dialyzer-dead clause in `Translation`

## 0.3.0 - 2026-05-18

### Added
- Manual sort mode on the endpoints list — picking "Manual" turns rows + cards into a drag-to-reorder `SortableGrid` target; `reorder_endpoints/2` rewrites `sort_order` via the shared `PhoenixKit.Utils.Reorder.reorder/4` two-phase primitive
- Reorder mutations log a single `endpoint.reordered` / `prompt.reordered` activity row with count metadata
- Optional Provider Settings (HTTP-Referer / X-Title) default from `PhoenixKit.Settings` (`site_url` / `project_title`) via `get_setting_cached/1`; per-endpoint fields act as pure overrides

### Changed
- **Minimum `phoenix_kit` is now 1.7.112** — this release uses `PhoenixKit.Utils.{Reorder,Values,Format}` and the `<.form_section>` / `:sort_bar` core components
- Endpoints + Prompts admin tables adopt `<.table_default toggleable>` (card + table views); sort UI moved to the core `:sort_bar` slot
- Endpoint form, Prompt form, Playground migrated to `<.form_section>` / `<.form_actions>` / core inputs — drops ~500 lines of hand-rolled form boilerplate
- Recent Requests table migrated to `<.table_default>`; columns tiered by importance against the admin sidebar breakpoint
- AI pages expand to full width on large screens
- `parse_sort_*` and actor-resolution helpers extracted to `PhoenixKitAI.Web.{SortHelpers,AuthHelpers}` (~75 lines of duplication removed)
- `reorder_prompts/2` migrated to the shared `Reorder.reorder/4` primitive (was an inline single-phase transaction); takes `[uuid]` instead of `[{uuid, sort_order}]`
- i18n: 14+ raw English strings wrapped in `gettext/1`; `@sort_options` moved to a request-time function so `gettext.extract` sees the labels

### Fixed
- Stable `:uuid` tiebreaker on every endpoint/prompt sort branch — tied sort-field values no longer reshuffle between pages/refreshes
- Replaced the bogus `{:id, "ID"}` endpoint sort option (no `id` column — it silently fell through to default sort) with `{:inserted_at, "Created"}`
- Endpoint "Enabled" toggle now submits a hidden `false` companion so unchecking actually persists
- `PromptForm` gained a `handle_info/2` catch-all so an unexpected message can't crash the form
- Quality sweep: all credo `--strict` findings closed (5 complexity refactors via behavior-preserving extraction); `mix precommit` green end to end

## 0.2.1 - 2026-05-12

### Fixed
- `format_price/1` no longer crashes on JSON-integer pricing (free-tier `0` from OpenRouter); coerces via `value * 1.0` before `:erlang.float_to_binary/2`
- Provider dropdown on `/admin/ai/endpoints/new` no longer surfaces the mount-default `"openrouter"` as a dead-end option when the operator has no OpenRouter integration configured

### Added
- Stale-fetch guard on `:fetch_models` — if the operator switches integrations between Task scheduling and message delivery, the response is dropped instead of repopulating models for the wrong integration

### Changed
- Quality sweep: 7 of 12 pre-existing credo findings closed (two `cond`→`if/else` conversions, five nested-module alias suggestions in tests) plus one dialyzer dead-pattern clause removed

## 0.2.0 - 2026-05-02

### Added
- Multi-provider support: Mistral and DeepSeek endpoints alongside OpenRouter
- Reasoning chain-of-thought capture (reasoning_effort, reasoning_max_tokens) in request history
- Strict-UUID Integrations API — endpoints pin to a specific integration row via `integration_uuid`
- Legacy `api_key` auto-migration with idempotency guards and `:persistent_term` rate-limiting
- Integration-health badges on endpoints list (missing, error, not connected)
- Integration name + masked API key display on endpoint cards
- SSRF guard on `base_url` (blocks localhost, RFC1918, link-local, IPv6 loopback/ULA)
- `endpoint.masked_api_key/1` head+tail mask (first 8 + last 4 chars)
- Provider-switch resets model selector to avoid stale cross-provider model IDs

### Changed
- Move LiveView data loading from `mount/3` to `handle_params/3` (avoids double-fetch)
- Endpoint form wires through changeset on integration deselect
- `OpenRouterClient` lazy-promotes legacy provider strings to `integration_uuid` on read
- Model fetcher generalized to any OpenAI-compatible `/models` endpoint
- DRY credential resolution across completion, validation, and model fetch

### Fixed
- Provider-switch URL reuse bug — switching provider now fetches models from the new provider's base URL
- Duplicated `mask_api_key/1` removed from Endpoints LiveView (consolidated into schema helper)
- `migrate_legacy/0` now surfaces inner `:error` instead of masking it as `{:ok, _}`
- Snapshot-based UUID lookups in migration prevent N+1 queries
- Compile warnings resolved against phoenix_kit 1.7.x

## 0.1.5 - 2026-04-12
